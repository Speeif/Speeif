Hiya! I'm Speeif, and I develop different software solutions that I think are neat. I enjoy tinkering with different languages and software tools, so many of my repositories is just me playing around and challenging myself.

This repository uses *Docker* to supply a dev-container (utilizint the VS-Code **Dev Container** extension) that has been configurated to use a localised plantuml runtime for designing diagrams.
